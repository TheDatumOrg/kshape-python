This data set is taken from the UCI repository. It is derived from sound.

Dataset from 8800 (10 digits x 10 repetitions x 88 speakers) time series of 13 Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs) had taken from 44 males and 44 females Arabic native speakers
between the ages 18 and 40 to represent ten spoken Arabic digit.

Each line on the data base represents 13 MFCCs coefficients in the increasing order separated by
spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame. The 13 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) are computed with the following
conditions;
Sampling rate: 11025 Hz, 16 bits
Window applied: hamming
Filter pre-emphasized: 1-0.97Z^(-1)
